# Finding and Creating Adjacent Nodes
#
# A node is represented by a list where the positions in the list
# indicate which other nodes a particular node is connected to.
# A node cannot be connected to itself and will therefore have a 
# 0 in the position that corresponds to the 2D list. 
# 
# Each node must contain a list of all nodes.
# 
# 1-way association
# [[0, 1, 1, 0],
# [0, 0, 1, 1],
# [0, 0, 0, 1],
# [1, 0, 0, 0]]
# 
# 2-way association
# [[0, 1, 0, 0],
# [1, 0, 1, 1],
# [0, 1, 1, 0],
# [0, 1, 0, 0]]
